• The Greenhouse Effect: How gases like carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor trap heat in the atmosphere.
• Human Impact: How burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes contribute to climate change.
• Consequences: The impacts of climate change such as rising temperatures, melting ice caps, and extreme weather events.
• Solutions: Steps we can take to reduce our carbon footprint and mitigate the effects of climate change.

This lesson introduces you to the key concepts of our changing climate.`;

  const greenhouseGasesContent = `Greenhouse Gases are the primary contributors to global warming. In this lesson, you'll learn:

• Key Gases: Such as carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH₄), and nitrous oxide (N₂O).
• Sources: How both natural processes and human activities release these gases.
• Impact: The role these gases play in trapping heat and influencing global temperatures.
• Mitigation: Strategies to reduce emissions and protect our environment.

Understanding greenhouse gases is essential for grasping the scale of climate change.`;

  const humanImpactContent = `Human Impact examines how human activities affect our planet. In this lesson, you'll discover:

• Environmental Degradation: The effects of pollution, deforestation, and resource depletion.
• Social & Economic Factors: How environmental changes influence communities and economies.
• Sustainability Challenges: The complexities of balancing development with conservation.
• Innovative Solutions: Emerging strategies and technologies to reduce human impact.

This lesson shows why understanding human impact is crucial to building a sustainable future.`;

  const consequencesContent = `Consequences of Climate Change focus on the real-world impacts, including:

• Rising Sea Levels: Threatening coastal communities and ecosystems.
• Extreme Weather Events: Increasing frequency and intensity of hurricanes, floods, droughts, and wildfires.
• Biodiversity Loss: The decline of species unable to adapt to rapid environmental changes.
• Economic and Social Disruptions: Challenges to agriculture, infrastructure, and public health.

This lesson explains the wide-ranging effects that climate change has on our world.`;

  const solutionsContent = `Solutions to Climate Change explore practical ways to address environmental challenges, including:

• Renewable Energy: Transitioning to wind, solar, and other clean energy sources.
• Energy Efficiency: Implementing technologies and practices that reduce energy consumption.
• Conservation and Reforestation: Protecting ecosystems and restoring natural habitats.
• Policy and Global Cooperation: Enacting measures and international agreements to curb emissions.

This lesson provides insights into how we can work together to build a more sustainable future.`;
