export const climateBasicsContent = `Climate Basics introduces the fundamental concepts behind climate change, weather patterns, and the Earth's atmospheric processes. This lesson covers:

• The Greenhouse Effect: An explanation of how greenhouse gases trap heat in the atmosphere, driving global warming.

• Key Greenhouse Gases: Insight into CO₂, methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases, and their impact on Earth's climate.

• Natural Versus Human Influences: A comparison of natural climate drivers (volcanoes, solar variations) versus human activities like fossil fuel burning and deforestation.

• Climate Data and Trends: An overview of how scientists measure and model climate change over time, including temperature records and ice core data.

This lesson provides the essential background needed to understand the more complex impacts and solutions related to climate change.`;

export const sustainableLivingContent = `Sustainable Living Fundamentals explores how individual choices create collective impact. This comprehensive introduction covers:

• Carbon Footprint Awareness: The average person's carbon footprint varies significantly by region - from 0.1 tons CO₂e in Madagascar to 14.7 tons in the United States annually. Understanding your personal impact is the first step to reduction.

• Circular Economy Participation: Moving beyond the "take-make-waste" model to embrace repair, sharing, and reuse. The global circular economy could reduce annual greenhouse gas emissions by 39% and raw material use by 28% by 2032.

• Sustainable Consumer Choices: With 72% of global greenhouse gas emissions linked to household consumption, your purchasing decisions matter. Learn to evaluate products based on their full lifecycle impact.

• Community Engagement: How local action creates global change - from community gardens to repair cafes, discover how collective action amplifies individual impact.

This foundation will transform how you think about daily choices and their broader environmental impact.`;

export const wasteReductionContent = `Waste Reduction Strategies addresses our global waste crisis through practical solutions:

• Zero-Waste Living: Beyond basic recycling to precycling - preventing waste before it occurs. With global waste expected to increase 73% by 2050, prevention is crucial.

• Food Waste Solutions: Using AI-powered apps for meal planning, understanding date labels, and composting. Food waste contributes 8-10% of global greenhouse gas emissions.

• Plastic-Free Living: Practical alternatives to single-use plastics, including new materials like mycelium packaging and seaweed-based alternatives. Only 9% of plastic ever produced has been recycled.

• Digital Decluttering: The hidden environmental cost of data storage - the internet's carbon footprint equals that of global air travel. Learn digital minimalism practices.

This lesson provides actionable steps to minimize waste in all aspects of modern life.`;

export const energyEfficiencyContent = `Energy Efficiency for the Modern Home combines traditional wisdom with cutting-edge technology:

• Smart Home Integration: Beyond basic LED bulbs - using AI-powered systems to optimize energy use. Smart home technology can reduce energy consumption by 20-30%.

• Passive Design Principles: Working with natural light and ventilation to reduce energy needs. Proper implementation can cut heating and cooling costs by 40%.

• Renewable Energy Integration: From community solar projects to heat pumps, understanding the latest in clean energy technology. Heat pump adoption could reduce global CO₂ emissions by 500 million tons by 2030.

• Behavioral Changes: Small habits with big impact - vampire power costs U.S. households $100+ annually. Learn about energy-efficient routines and their cumulative effect.

This lesson empowers you with knowledge to significantly reduce home energy consumption.`;

export const sustainableTransportContent = `Sustainable Transportation explores the future of mobility:

• Micromobility Revolution: The rise of e-bikes, scooters, and car-sharing services. E-bike sales are projected to reach 40 million units globally by 2025.

• Public Transit Innovation: How cities are reimagining public transportation with autonomous vehicles and integrated mobility apps.

• Remote Work Impact: Understanding how hybrid work models can reduce transportation emissions - remote work could reduce carbon emissions by 54 million tons annually.

• Future of Electric Vehicles: Beyond personal cars to electric buses, trucks, and planes. The EV market is expected to reach 40% of global auto sales by 2030.

This lesson helps you navigate the rapidly evolving transportation landscape.`;

export const sustainableFoodContent = `Sustainable Food Systems examines the intersection of diet and environmental impact:

• Plant-Based Transitions: Understanding the environmental impact of different diets. Plant-based alternatives could reduce food-related emissions by 70%.

• Local Food Systems: The rise of urban farming, vertical gardens, and community-supported agriculture. Urban agriculture could provide 15-20% of global food.

• Regenerative Agriculture: How consumer choices support sustainable farming practices. Regenerative agriculture could sequester 322 billion tons of CO₂.

• Food Technology: From lab-grown meat to precision fermentation, exploring sustainable protein alternatives projected to reach 11% of the protein market by 2035.

This lesson connects daily food choices to global environmental impact.`;
